### Objective
The objective of this project is to implement infrastructure automation using Terraform. Terraform will be utilized to define and provision cloud resources in a repeatable and consistent manner across different environments.

### Key Activities
**Terraform Configuration:** Define infrastructure components like AWS EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, and security groups using Terraform's declarative language.
**Deployment Automation:** Use Terraform commands (init, plan, apply) to automate provisioning, updating, and destroying of infrastructure.
**Version Control:** Manage Terraform configurations with Git for versioning and collaboration.

### Technologies Used
**Terraform:** Infrastructure as code tool for managing cloud infrastructure across providers.
**AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Cloud platform for hosting and managing resources provisioned via Terraform.
**Git:** Version control system for managing and tracking changes in Terraform configurations.

### Key Insights
**Efficiency:** Streamline infrastructure deployment and updates with automated workflows.
**Consistency:** Ensure uniformity and reliability across environments using code-defined infrastructure.
**Scalability:** Scale resources up or down as needed, optimizing cost and performance.


This project focuses on leveraging Terraform for infrastructure automation, enhancing efficiency, scalability, and reliability in cloud infrastructure management.
